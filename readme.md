# Pam's Harvestcraft 2 CraftTweaker script generator

"I'll make my own configuration files, with blackjack and hookers!"

## How to use:

First, export all food values of the mods you want to modify using the "printlog.zs" CT script. Copy the output from the server log to a file named ctlog.txt in this directory (you only have to do this one, and the already included ctlog.txt from my personal modpack might already be enough for you).

Then, use the (arguably very overkill) "scriptmaker.py" Python script to define rules for food modification and export the actual CT scripts to use with the mod.
